# Work with the course-leads to schedule your one-on-one observations before the due date
* A paid LA will observe you during your closed/open lab session
* The paid LA will record information about your interaction with the student (similar to the shadowing exercise that you completed for h03). Ask them to use this form: [http://bit.ly/190J-Peer-observation-form](http://bit.ly/190J-Peer-observation-form)
* The course instructor will use the information from the feedback form to grade your tutoring performance.
