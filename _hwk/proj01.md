# Work with the course-leads to schedule your one-on-one observations before the due date
* A paid tutor will observe you during your closed/open lab session
* The paid tutor will record information about your interaction with the student (similar to the shadowing exercise that you completed for h03)
* The course instructor will use the information from the feedback form to grade your tutoring performance.
