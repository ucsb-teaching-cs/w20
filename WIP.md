# Impromptu explain a course topic

CS16 Topics:
* Binary/Octal/Hex 
* Linked Lists
* Recursion
* Pointers
* Stack vs Heap
* etc.

You will draw a topic out of a hat, and you will be asked to explain it to a student that says: "I'm having trouble with X".

OR you'll be asked to help with someone that is stuck on some code.

What do you do?    We'll practice this.

Practice it first in plenary session--then in smaller groups.

* Initial observation for feedback in week 4/5... real setting, real students (tutor office hours, or during open labs)
* Later observation for course grade, in week 6/7... real setting, real students (tutor office hours, can be repeated up to two times).

TODO: Schedule on our own faculty calendars... when those visits are going to happen, for each student.
