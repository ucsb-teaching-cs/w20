# Scheduling your one-on-one observations
* You have two tries on this assignment. If you feel that your first observation did not go well, you may request your instructor for a second try
* A paid tutor will observe you during your closed/open lab session
* The paid tutor will record information about your interaction with the student (similar to the shadowing exercise that you completed for h03)
* The course instructor will use the information from the feedback form to grade your tutoring performance.
