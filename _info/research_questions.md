Possible research questions that could be investigated in the context of the courses using undergrad tutors.

Note: not all of these are directy tied to using tutors, but may be easier to administer with the extra adminstrative support and staffing that the tutors offer.

* Suppose that students receive periodic reports on how they are doing in the course.  

    Assuming that the content of those reports is identical, which is preferable: 
    * A mail merge that is formatting as a personal email from the instructor of record
    * A FEEDBACK repo constructed by a peer mentor, with an email letting the student know it is available
    * Something else?
    
    Other questions to investigate:
    
    * Best frequency?
    * What is the metric to measure effectiveness? Is it student preference? Is it the number of responses? Is it some measureable delta in actual student performance?
