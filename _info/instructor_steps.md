This page is a work in progress; it is a placeholder for the steps that an instructor needs to take at the start 
of the quarter, during the quarter, etc. to manage the undergrad tutor program.

# 2-3 quarters before: Planning

* Plan tutor allocation to courses
    * Determine which course instructors are interested in having tutors
    * Determine which instructors are willing to help with CS190J
    * Determine how many paid tutor slots will be available
    * Determine how many slots will be made available for CS190J
* Put the CS190J lecture section and discusssion sections on the schedule.   
   * Avoid times that would conflict with popular undergrad courses for the target audience of paid/CS190J tutors (e.g. required CS courses such as CS130A, CS170, etc.)
   * Avoid all of the discussion and lecture sections for the courses taught by the instructors
   * Schedule "discussion sections" on GOLD as 3 hours that overlap with the discussion sections that are being tutored for.   

# Late in the quarter BEFORE: Selection of students

* Make a Google Form to collect info from prospective CS190J students, and from prospective Paid tutors
   * TODO: Link to sample forms for 190J and paid tutors (there is overlap but they are different.)
* Send out advertisements via Undergrad mailing lists, via mailing lists of courses, to selected students, etc. advertising the CS190J course
    * TODO: Link to sample marketing materials.
* Advertise the paid tutor availability to all previous paid tutors, and all students that have previously taken CS190J
    * TODO: Link to sample advert
* Meeting of instructors to select paid tutors and CS190J students.
   * Send info to CS staff to start hiring process for paid tutors
   * Send add codes to CS190J students to get them enrolled.


# Course Design, CS190J AND for individual courses  2-4 weeks before start of quarter

Instructional tasks for CS190J

* Set up Syllabus for CS190J.  Choose how finals will be assigned.
* Set up projects, homeworks, outline of lectures/activities for plenary sessions

Instructional tasks for each course:

* Decide how you want to use the tutors in your course
   * Allocation of tutor hours to discussion sections, vs. open lab time.
   * Whether there will be a specific mapping from tutors to individual students (e.g. mentor groups, teams, etc.) or not
   * Whether/how tutors/mentors will be involved in providing feedback on students work.  Which work? Homework? Programming assignents?  Formative or summative? etc.

# CS190J Plenary Tasks: 1-2 weeks before start of quarter

* Set up Piazza/slack for all CS190J and paid tutors
* Set up Gauchospace.  
* IF there is shared open lab time
    * Coordinate a schedule of when tutors (and TAs if applicable) are signed up to be available during those lab times ([link to Example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRuoMhndVzqCkuCouf6Sxq5FFMNu7VMQaQrtB45LspZjMQyoBeb5X5VJP12G3JZcSS3vgYLRSTczIYx/pubhtml?gid=833009799&single=true))
* Get keys to the labs from Benji and plan to make one of the tutors or TAs in charge of opening the room and locking it.

# OPTIONAL per course tasks (at discretion of individual instructor)

* Set up Slack for team
* Include on your course site information about the tutors - pics, bios etc. 
   * TO DO : Include samples
