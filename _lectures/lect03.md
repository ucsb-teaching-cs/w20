   * Or you can find your own using the [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org) to look for papers in the list of educational conferences and journals in your domain.  
   * Any paper that is "related work" to the ones in the list is acceptable (i.e. cited by, or cites).
   * If you go further afield than that, please check in with your supervising instructor; send them a link to the paper in the Digital Library.  (The "ACM Ref") is a good way to cite it.
